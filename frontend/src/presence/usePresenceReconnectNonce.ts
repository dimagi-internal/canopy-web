/**
 * A counter that bumps every time this tab is told the user's presence
 * preference changed — same-tab (the Settings toggle) or cross-tab (another
 * open tab's toggle, via `BroadcastChannel`; see events.ts).
 *
 * AppLayout keys its presence-socket subtree on this value
 * (`<PresenceHeaderBadge key={usePresenceReconnectNonce()} />`): bumping it
 * forces React to unmount the old subtree — closing its WebSocket in
 * `usePresence`'s cleanup — and mount a fresh one, which reconnects and
 * sends a brand-new `presence.enter` under the just-saved preference. The
 * `PresenceConsumer` only re-reads visibility on `presence.enter`, so
 * without this an opted-out user would stay visible in every tab already
 * open on a page until each one happened to navigate.
 *
 * Split out of AppLayout so this — the riskiest, least-obviously-correct
 * piece of the toggle — is unit-testable on its own (see
 * usePresenceReconnectNonce.test.ts) without mounting the whole app shell.
