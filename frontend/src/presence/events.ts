/**
 * Signal: "the user just changed their presence visibility preference; the
 * presence socket should reconnect and re-enter under the new preference
 * right now, instead of waiting for its next navigation."
 *
 * Same-tab: a plain `window` CustomEvent, dispatched synchronously. This is
 * a one-shot fire-and-forget signal, not shared state, so a full context
 * provider linking SettingsPage and AppLayout would be overkill.
 *
 * Cross-tab: `BroadcastChannel`, best-effort. Without this, a second open
 * tab — which never ran `togglePresence` itself, so never dispatches the
 * `window` event in ITS OWN document — would keep showing the user in
 * whatever roster it's currently in until that tab happens to navigate on
 * its own. That's a real privacy gap: opting out is supposed to mean OUT,
 * not "out in the tab I happened to click it in." Feature-detected so
 * environments without `BroadcastChannel` (very old browsers, some
 * sandboxed webviews) keep exactly the same-tab-only behavior this module
 * already had.
 *
 * `BroadcastChannel` delivers to every OTHER open channel object on this
 * name — including a second channel object opened by THIS SAME tab (a
 * `subscribeToPresencePreferenceChanged` call elsewhere in this document).
 * Left alone, that would double-fire the origin tab's own subscribers: once
 * synchronously via the `window` event, once (asynchronously, on a real
 * task — not just a microtask) via its own broadcast echoing back.
 * `TAB_ID` tags every broadcast with an id unique to this page load, and
 * `subscribeToPresencePreferenceChanged` ignores a broadcast carrying its
 * own tab's id — the `window` event already covers that case.
