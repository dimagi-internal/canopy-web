"""Viewer presence over WebSocket: one socket per browser tab.

Navigation re-keys the connection with a fresh `presence.enter` rather than
reconnecting.

Two rules carry the security weight of this surface:

1. The page key is CLIENT-SUPPLIED. Its workspace segment is checked against
   the user's memberships before any group is joined — otherwise a user
   could observe who is viewing a workspace they cannot access. Membership
   is checked LIVE on every `presence.enter`, never cached for the life of
   the connection: a long-lived socket must not keep granting access to a
   workspace the user has since been removed from. A REJECTED enter (bad
   key or lost membership) also tears down any group the connection
   currently holds — otherwise a member revoked mid-session would keep
   receiving their old workspace's roster broadcasts until they disconnect.
2. Visibility is enforced HERE, not on the client. An opted-out user joins
   the group (so they still see others) but is never written to Redis, so
   no client — tampered, stale, or otherwise — can expose them. Like
   membership, visibility is re-read on every `presence.enter` rather than
   cached at connect time, so flipping "Show me as viewing" off bounds the
   exposure window to "until you next navigate" rather than "until you
   close the tab".
