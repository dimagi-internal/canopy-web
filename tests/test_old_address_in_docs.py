"""No human-facing doc sends a reader to canopy's OLD address.

canopy moved from https://labs.connect.dimagi.com/canopy/ to
https://canopy.dimagi.com/ on 2026-10-05. The old address still serves machine
traffic and 302s browser pages to the new one, so a stale link in a doc looks
like it works (a ``curl -L`` check follows the 302 and sees 200) — which is how
ACE shipped one in ace#2762 (canopy#803).

This checks the markdown a person or an agent reads for instructions. It allows
a line that names BOTH addresses — that line is describing the move (CLAUDE.md's
*Deployment* note does). Code that deliberately handles the old address
(``apps/common/legacy_prefix.py``, ``CANOPY_FORMER_BASE_URLS``, the tests that
assert old-address routing) is not markdown and is not checked. Recorded history
(archived and dated plans/specs) is left as written.
Pure stdlib; no Django setup.
